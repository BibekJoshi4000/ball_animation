# Turtle Animation Program

This is my first attempt at creating an animation using the Turtle graphics library in Python. The program creates a simple animation with four colored circles bouncing around the screen.

## Description

This program utilizes the Turtle graphics library to create an animated scene. Four circles of different colors (blue, green, yellow, and red) move around the screen, bouncing off the edges to create a visually appealing animation.

## Features

- Colorful circles: The circles are represented using the Turtle library's  turtles shaped as circles of different colors representing balls.
- Bouncing animation: The circles move in a bouncing manner, reflecting off the edges of the screen, which adds a dynamic element to the animation.
- Simple code structure: The code is structured in a straightforward manner, making it easy to understand even for beginners.
